# 🔴 The Int16 Skin ID API Failure

> Why Paladins skin IDs above 32,767 break the Hi-Rez match API, with a database-sourced list of known affected skins.

## The Problem

Some Paladins `skin_id` values now exceed the signed 16-bit integer maximum of **32,767**, but part of the Hi-Rez match-data path still attempts to deserialize the field as an `Int16`. The value cannot fit, so the API emits an explicit error message instead of returning the affected player row:

```text
Value was either too large or too small for an Int16. Failing Field = skin_id
```

### What happens above the boundary?

| `skin_id` | Above Int16 maximum | API result |
|---:|:---:|:---|
| 32,829 | Yes | Player row dropped; Int16 `ret_msg` returned |
| 33,060 | Yes | Player row dropped; Int16 `ret_msg` returned |
| 33,741 | Yes | Player row dropped; Int16 `ret_msg` returned |

The failure is **not silent**. When a positive skin ID exceeds the Int16 limit of **32,767**, the Hi-Rez API returns an Int16 error and drops the match data.
