# Beyond the Int16 Overflow: Recovering the Match Hi-Rez Drops

> One broken skin can truncate a match response and leave the result incomplete or unavailable. PaladinsCat treats that failure as recoverable evidence.

## From a known bug to a working recovery system

Our [first Int16 overflow post](skin-id-overflow.md) documented the numeric boundary behind broken Paladins skin data. Skin IDs now exceed the signed 16-bit maximum of **32,767**, but part of the Hi-Rez match-data path still attempts to read the value as an `Int16`.

The boundary itself was not a new discovery. The issue had been known for more than five years. The breakthrough that started PaladinsCat development in **May 2026** was understanding how the failure disrupts raw match responses—and building a system that reconstructs complete results from incomplete or failed data.

This post follows that failure from the raw Hi-Rez payload to the final PaladinsCat scoreboard.

---

## What the raw API response looks like

The practical failure appears in the raw match-details response. Player data is processed in order. When the API reaches a player using an affected skin, it returns an Int16 error; earlier rows may survive as a valid prefix while the affected row and everything after it is dropped:

```json
[
  {
    "Match": 1280822548,
    "TaskForce": 1,
    "playerId": "<valid player ID>",
    "SkinId": "<valid skin ID>",
    "ret_msg": null
  },
  {
    "...": "four more valid Team 1 player rows"
  },
  {
    "Match": 1280822548,
    "playerId": 0,
    "SkinId": "<value above 32767>",
    "ret_msg": "Value was either too large or too small for an Int16. Failing Field = skin_id"
  }
]
```

> [!NOTE]
> This is an abridged representation of the response shape. Repeated player statistics and unrelated fields are omitted; the `ret_msg` text is preserved exactly.

This is not a normal HTTP failure with a clean error status. Valid player objects and an application-level `ret_msg` can arrive in the same response. A consumer must understand both the order and the incompleteness of the payload.

The surviving fragment is not fixed. The failure can occur at any player position, leaving anywhere from zero to nine usable rows before the affected row and everything after it is dropped. The cases below are observed examples, not the only possible response shapes.

### Observed Example: Broken Skin in Player Position Six

The response stops being useful at the broken row. If the affected skin appears in player position six—the first slot on Team 2—the API has already emitted the five Team 1 players. The broken sixth row becomes the sentinel, and the remaining Team 2 rows never arrive.

That exact shape is visible for match [`1280822548`](https://paladinscat.com/matches/1280822548):

![PaladinsAssistant showing only the five Team 1 players for match 1280822548](../assets/int16-match-recovery/paladins-assistant-partial-team-dropout.jpg)

*PaladinsAssistant displays the five-player prefix. Team 2 is absent after the broken skin occupies the sixth player position.*

Returning five valid rows is especially dangerous because the payload looks partially successful. A client that only checks whether the array is non-empty can render half a scoreboard without realizing that the other team was dropped.

### Observed Example: Broken Skin in Player Position One

The more extreme failure happens when the affected skin belongs to the first player in the ordered payload. The serializer fails before it emits a single valid player row:

```json
[
  {
    "Match": 1280790711,
    "playerId": 0,
    "SkinId": "<value above 32767>",
    "ret_msg": "Value was either too large or too small for an Int16. Failing Field = skin_id"
  }
]
```

There is no healthy prefix to preserve. The first player becomes the error sentinel, the other nine players are never emitted, and all ten player rows disappear from the direct result. Consumers that expect a normal scoreboard receive an API error or treat the match as missing.

## How the failure appears to players

The examples below show the extreme first-position failure for match `1280790711`: the broken skin is encountered before any valid player row, so the direct payload loses all ten players. Different consumers surface that same upstream failure in different ways. These screenshots are not presented as criticism of the services involved; they document the user-visible outcomes of the failed Hi-Rez response.

### Generic command failure

![PaladinsAssistant returning a generic error for match 1280790711](../assets/int16-match-recovery/paladins-assistant-api-error.jpg)

*PaladinsAssistant cannot render match `1280790711` and returns a generic retry or bug message.*

### Explicit broken-skin error

*Itto Bot recognizes the affected-skin condition but still cannot provide the match result.*

### Match not found

*Paladins.guru surfaces the failed upstream result as “404 — Match not found.”*

The visible outcomes differ, but the lost information is the same: the player cannot inspect the complete match.

## Failure and Recovery Flow

PaladinsCat treats the Hi-Rez error and any surviving player rows as a damaged evidence set—not as proof that the whole match is unusable. At a public level, recovery follows this flow:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Receive match response"] --> B{"Complete and usable?"}
    B -->|Yes| C["Publish standard match result"]
    B -->|No| D["Classify match as broken"]
    D --> E["Preserve usable evidence"]
    E --> F["Gather independent match evidence"]
    F --> G["Reconstruct missing records"]
    G --> H{"Recovery validation passes?"}
    H -->|Yes| I["Publish recovered result<br/>with source labels"]
    H -->|No| J["Retain limited result<br/>with recovery state visible"]
```

> [!NOTE]
> This diagram describes PaladinsCat's public recovery behavior. Internal endpoints, lookup order, storage layers, and validation rules are intentionally omitted.

### Match Health and Provenance Legend

Match health tags describe the condition of the result. Provenance labels describe where individual player records came from. The two are separate and may appear together.

#### Match Health Tags

| Tag | Public meaning |
|:---|:---|
| `Broken` | The original match response failed or dropped data. |
| `Partial` | Only part of the expected match data is available. |
| `Recovered` | Missing match data was reconstructed and the recovered result passed validation. |
| `Private` | The match contains one or more private-profile participants, so some identity details may be unavailable. |
| `Limited` | The match is available with reduced detail; unavailable fields remain clearly identified. |

#### Player-Row Provenance

| Label | Public meaning |
|:---|:---|
| `direct` | The player record came from the original match response. |
| `recovered` | The player record was reconstructed from independent match evidence. |
| `minimal` | Only a limited player record could be established. |

A `Limited` match may contain `minimal` player records, but a health tag and a provenance label are not interchangeable.

## Direct evidence and recovered evidence working together

Match [`1280822548`](https://paladinscat.com/matches/1280822548) demonstrates the mixed-source path:

- The external partial result shows only five players.
- PaladinsCat publishes all ten authoritative player rows.
- Five surviving rows retain `source=direct`.
- Five missing rows are restored with `source=recovered`.
- The match remains labeled `broken=true` and `recovered=true`, so the repair is visible rather than hidden.

Match [`1280790711`](https://paladinscat.com/matches/1280790711) demonstrates full reconstruction after the first-position failure. Because the broken skin appears before any valid direct row, all ten players must be recovered. Its live PaladinsCat result contains ten authoritative rows with `source=recovered` and retains two confirmed-cheater account tags that would otherwise be hidden behind an API error or missing-match page.

*PaladinsCat publishes the complete scoreboard for match `1280790711`, labels it Recovered, and retains account-level evidence on the affected player rows.*

## Why this is the breakthrough

The breakthrough is not the discovery that **32,767** is the Int16 limit. It is recognizing that the Hi-Rez response before the sentinel is still valuable, that the absent rows can be reconstructed from independent match evidence, and that direct and recovered facts must remain distinguishable.

The consolidated flow above turns a long-standing upstream failure into a transparent data-quality state. For players, the difference is simple: instead of an error, half a team, or a 404, they receive a complete scoreboard with visible provenance and evidence that remains available for community review.
